# Frequency Distribution of Qualtive Data
# 데이터의 빈도수
# frequency distribution of a data is a summary of the data occurrence in a colltion of non-overlapping categories
# problem find the frequency distribution of the painters in the data set painters

school = painters$School
school.freq = table(school) # apply the table function
?table #빈도수를 측정하는 테이블 만들기
school.freq
cbind(school.freq)
?cbind #combine r object by rows or column 행 열을 변환해서 보여줌

#exercise
# 1.find thre frequency distribution of the composition scores in painters
composition = painters$Composition

composition.freq = table(composition)

cbind(composition.freq)

# relative frequency of qualitative data
# 데이터의 상대 빈도수
# relative frequency == frequency / sample SI

school.freq
?nrow # the number of rows
?ncol # the number of columns
school.refreq = school.freq / nrow(painters)
school.refreq
school.refreq * 100

#exercise
# find the relative frequency distribution of the composition scores in painters
composition.freq
composition.refreq = composition.freq / nrow(painters)
composition.refreq * 100

# Bar Graph
# a bar graph of a qualitative data sample consists of vertical parallel bars that show the frequncy distribution graphically
barplot(school.freq)

# add color at bars
colors = c("red","yellow","green","violet","orange","blue","pink","cyan")
barplot(school.freq, col = colors)

# exercise
# find the bar graph of composition scores in painters

barplot(composition.freq)
barplot(composition.freq, col = colors) #bar 색깔이 모자르면 recycle 된다.

# Pie Chart
# a pie chart of qualitative data sample consists of pizza wedges that shows the frequency distribution graphically

pie(school.freq)
pie(school.freq, col = colors)

#exercise
# find the pie chart of composition scores in painters
pie(composition.freq)

#category statistics
# find out the mean of composition scores of school C in the data set painters
school

c_school = school == "C" #school == "C" 에 따른 TRUE, FALASE 백터를 c_school 에 저장
c_school
c_painters = painters[c_school, ] #logical indexing(TRUE, FALSE 로 구성된 백터) 을 사용해서 원하는 로우 추출
c_painters

#use taaply function to compute them at once
tapply(painters$Composition, painters$School, mean)
?tapply #tapply(object, INDEX, function) object에 index 로 분류해서 function을 적용함

#exercise
# find programmatically the school with the highest composition score
tapply(painters$Composition, painters$School, sum)

# find the percentage of painters whose color score is equal to or above 14
color = painters$Colour
c_color = color >= 16
c_color

#위와 동일한식
